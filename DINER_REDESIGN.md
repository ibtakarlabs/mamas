# Complete Diner Redesign - Mama's Luncheonette

## The Problem
The original design looked like a "minimal beige cafe website" or "retirement home newsletter" - way too pale, delicate, and polite. It had NO diner energy.

## The Solution
Complete redesign with **warm, chunky, nostalgic, and BOLD** diner aesthetics.

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Chunky not delicate** - Thick borders, bold fonts, strong shadows
2. **Warm not clinical** - Cream backgrounds, warm whites, red accents
3. **Nostalgic not modern** - Stars, dividers, uppercase, retro details
4. **Compact not airy** - Tight spacing, cozy sections, packed layout
5. **Bold not subtle** - Black outlines, uppercase text, high contrast
6. **Textured not flat** - Paper grain, shadows, layered borders
